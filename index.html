            <h1>Who is Steve Irwin?</h1>
            <p>Steve’s life was a cocktail of love, passion, enthusiasm and respect for wildlife. His excitement over the most deadly snake or tiniest lizard brought him to the forefront of animal conservation. He set the precedent for making sure his fellow humans cared for and respected wildlife and the environment as much as he did.
<br>
<br>
                Steve changed the world with his extreme conservation efforts and innovative ideas. He was a true blue Aussie bloke whose energy and passion shone through in all he did. Steve’s legacy will live on forever. Through fellow Wildlife Warriors, wife Terri and children Bindi and Robert, his conservation work and larger then life personality 
                will endure.

                 <h1>Growing Up</h1>

                 <p>Living in a home housed with dangerous snakes, lizards, injured birds and orphaned kangaroos was the norm for the Irwin family. His mum, Lyn cared for injured and orphaned animals. Steve used to say his Mum was the Mother Teresa of wildlife rehabilitation! There was not a room in their home that did not house a rescued animal of some description. It was inevitable that as Steve grew up, his passion would be for wildlife and the environment because it always came so naturally to him.
<br>
<br>
                    In 1970, the family decided to relocate to Beerwah on the beautiful Sunshine Coast, in Queensland. There they began a quaint little reptile park and that’s how it remained until in 1992 Steve and Terri had the idea of taking their passion for conservation to the rest of the world.

        <h1>The Australia Zoo</h1>
        <p>Steve was born into wildlife, growing up on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, helping his parents at the ‘Beerwah Reptile Park’. Established in 1970, this two-acre wildlife park was home to native wildlife such as lace monitors, tiger snakes, freshwater crocodiles, magpie geese and kangaroos. Many of the kangaroos were cared for in homemade pouches by Steve’s mum, Lyn. She was an extraordinary wildlife rehabilitator and was quite skilled in nursing injured and orphaned animals, rehabilitating them before returning them to the wild.
<br>
<br>
            As the popularity of The Crocodile Hunter grew, Steve and Terri changed the name of their now growing wildlife park to ‘Australia Zoo’. Their mission was to make this zoo the very best in Australia, if not the world! Extensive efforts were made to create habitats, so that all zoo animals could be exhibited in 
            natural environments.</p>
